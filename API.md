Siad API
========

All API calls return JSON objects. If there is an error, the error is returned
in plaintext. The standard response is { "Success": true}. In this document,
the API responses are defined as go structs. The go structs will get encoded to
JSON before being sent. Go structs are used here to provide type information.

At version 0.4, the API will be locked into forwards compatibility. This means
that we will not remove elements from the responses (but we may add additional
elements), and we will not add any required parameters (though we may add
optional parameters, and we may disable parameters).
