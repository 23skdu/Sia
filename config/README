Sia

(Sorry if this README seems overly basic, I want to make sure that everyone can follow along)

Run 'siad' in a command prompt or terminal. You can drag-and-drop the siad file if you are not familiar with the command line. It'll probably say something like 'C:\stuff\siad', which I will refer to as 'siad'.

For Sia to work, you'll need to put the 'style' folder somewhere that siad can find it. The first place that Sia checks is your home folder, in $home/.config/sia/styles. (In the future this will be handled by an installer)

If you aren't sure where your home folder is, you can run 'siad home-folder'.

run 'siad -h' for more information, and see the sample config file (which should also generally be in $home/.config/sia/styles) if you want to poke aroud some more.
